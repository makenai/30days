# 30days.in

This is a goal setting and tracking application started, but not finished by myself and [Alice](http://twitter.com/alice7777). It's a good start to the project but on extended hiatus for now. The inspiration behind the idea was this TED talk by Matt Cutts [Try something new for 30 days](http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_cutts_try_something_new_for_30_days). I still think it's an app I would use.
